# System Scripts Repository

This folder contains various scripts related to system operations, diagnostics, and utilities.

## Overview

The intention behind this repository is to maintain a centralized collection of scripts that assist in managing and retrieving system-related information. Whether it's about querying system stats, automating certain tasks, or running diagnostics, you will find scripts tailored for those purposes here.

## Structure

- `diagnostics/`: Scripts related to system diagnostics.
- `utilities/`: Utility scripts that offer various functionalities for system operations.
- `management/`: Scripts to help manage system configurations.

## Contributing

If you wish to add a new script:

1. Ensure it doesn't already exist in the folder.
2. Place the script in the relevant sub-directory (or create one if necessary).
3. Update this `README.md` with a brief description of your script.

## Usage

Please ensure you understand the operation of a script before executing it, especially if it makes changes to the system. It's recommended to have backups and test in a controlled environment first.

## Disclaimer
